# TicketManager
Ticket Management System

This basic ticket management system was built during a summer internship with Vintage Software. The project was built in ASP.NET 4.5 as a single-page application implemented using AngularJS. The project is not entirely finished, and was primarily built to learn about the ASP.NET and AngularJS frameworks.

Features include ticket management, ticket category management, and user management as well as a basic login system, chat system, and simple admintrative tools.
